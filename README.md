## Hi there 👋 My name is [Patryk Komendo!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patryk-komendo/)

### :technologist: About me 
I am motivated to start my journey in the IT world as a Software Tester. I was acquiring my knowledge and skills through various types of courses, internet research, or books about testing. Thanks to that, I became a Software Development Academy graduate and a certified tester (ISTQB). I am prepared for further learning and development. 

### 😄 What do I do for fun? 
I am keen on strength sport disciplines.:muscle: Apart from that, I am huge fan of video games. :video_game: In my free time, I also like to delve into the intriguing world of astrophysics. 🚀
