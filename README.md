## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Patryk and I am Software Tester Candidate.

### About me
I am motivated to start my journey in the IT world as a Software Tester. I was acquiring my knowledge and skills through various types of courses, internet research, or books about testing. Thanks to that, I became a Software Development Academy graduate and a certified tester (ISTQB). I am prepared for further learning and development.

### What do I do for fun?
Privately, I am keen on strength sport disciplines. Apart from that, I am a fan of computer games. In my free time, I also like to delve into the intriguing world of astrophysics.
