### Hi there 👋 My name is Patryk.
I am motivated to start my journey in the IT world as a Software Tester. I was acquiring my knowledge and skills through various types of courses, internet research, or books about testing. Thanks to that, I became a Software Development Academy graduate and a certified tester (ISTQB). I am prepared for further learning and development.
